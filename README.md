# Kotlin Essential Training

This repository hosts an extensively-modified adaptation of the code originally featured in the **Kotlin Essential
Training** course from LinkedIn Learning, instructed by Troy Miles (currently unavailable on the LinkedIn Learning
website). The course delivered a thorough exploration of the Kotlin programming language, covering topics from
fundamental data types to advanced class implementations.
